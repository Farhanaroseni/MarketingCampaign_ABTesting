# Marketing Campaign Data with A/B Testing

## Introduction

## About dataset

This 'Marketing A/B Testing' dataset was sourced from Kaggle. It contains data of people that was exposed to ads (experimental group) and also people (control group) that would see a Public Service Annoucement (PSA) (or nothing) in the exact size and place the ad would normally be. The idea of the dataset is to analyze the groups, find if the ads were successful, how much the company can make from the ads, and if the difference between the groups is statistically significant.

Column Details:
* user id: User ID (unique)
* test group: If "ad" the person saw the advertisement, if "psa" they only saw the public service announcement
* converted: If a person bought the product then True, else is False
* total ads: Amount of ads seen by person
* most ads day: Day that the person saw the biggest amount of ads
* most ads hour: Hour of day that the person saw the biggest amount of ads
